*This is a stream of consciousness post.*

There is a black hanging fan covered in dust on its front grate. There is wood that has been clearly punished by the elements. There are rusted pieces of iron hanging and bolted in the wood. The rain gutter is patinaâ€™d and rusting. The pavement is cracked and scattered with marks. The floor slopes unevenly, first up then down, it is charming.

The imperfection is a testament to humanity. It is a push against the overengineering. Yet engineering is also beautiful. It is also a testament to human ingenuity and intelligence. But maybe it is a stepping stone. An idea and a path toward something bigger.

There is dust in many places. Sootsprites or susuwatari from Ghibli.

*The consciousness was pretty short today.*
