I try not to hate too much. But I really dislike fireworks. In the right context, when I’m far enough away, they’re alright at times.

But when people set them off in the parking lot next to an apartment building full of people, it’s awful. Besides one potentially hitting a building, there are lots of people who suffer from disorders made bad by setting off fireworks.

Anyway. That’s all I got for today.
