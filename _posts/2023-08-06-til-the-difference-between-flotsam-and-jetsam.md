Today I learned the difference between *flotsam* and *jetsam*. I was listening to [Dimension 20](https://www.dropout.tv/dimension-20) and I had actually never heard of either of those words before. A Google search led me to [NOAA’s NOA website](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/flotsam-jetsam.html), which defined the difference between the terms.

Apparently it is often used as a phrase, sort of like “odds and ends” but “flotsam and jetsam.” But there is a distinction:

> Flotsam is defined as debris in the water that was not deliberately thrown overboard, often as a result from a shipwreck or accident. Jetsam describes debris that was deliberately thrown overboard by a crew of a ship in distress, most often to lighten the ship's load.

This distinction is important because flotsam can be claimed by the original owner of the debris, while jetsam can be claimed as property of whoever ends up discovering it.

So, I guess the moral of story is, if you think you’re going down, then hold on to as much stuff as you can? Nah, that can’t be right…
