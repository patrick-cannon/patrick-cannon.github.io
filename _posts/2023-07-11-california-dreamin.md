I just got back from five days in California. And I gotta tell ya, it was awesome.

As a midwesterner, the coasts are such a nice vacation. California, in particular, gets shit-talked a lot in the circles I run in. But it feels worlds away. It is easy to forget how huge America really is, and spending time so far away really can unclog one’s mind.

The purpose of the trip was to visit family, and that was nice. It was a bit much, too. But nice.

We spent some time in Sacramento, then a few days in Napa Valley. I’m not a big wine guy, so some of the tasting was lost on me. However, I learned **a lot** about the chemistry and ecology that goes into growing wine, and that was illuminating.

Spending time among the lush hills and small towns was fun. There is something that is grounding about places with less people.

Many of the restaurants we visited were reminiscent of older decades, and seeing the juxtaposition between buildings almost 100 years old and new boutique shopping stores evokes a very specific feeling for me. I’m not sure what to call it exactly, but it’s pleasant.
