Another lazy post for today. Brennan from Dimension 20 is teaching me so many new things!

In many animals—like dogs, cats, birds, etc.— what we think of as the “knees” are actually the ankles! These animals have [digitigrade locomation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitigrade). That means they walk around on their toes as opposed to the flat parts of their feet (metatarsals) plus their toes (like humans, which is known as plantigrade locomation). That means your cat is literally tip-toeing when it sneaks up on you!

Here is an example image from Wikipedia:

Anyway, interesting stuff!
