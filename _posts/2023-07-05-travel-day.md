I’m traveling today. By plane! I haven’t been on a plane since pre-pandemic days. I’m finding myself to both have more and less anxiety about it than I thought. I wanted to get something out before I flew in case I was too tired to write after I land, so this will be quite short. Maybe I’ll update this post or publish a new one today after I arrive. Who knows!
