The value of vultures is vast. Vultures are vital. Healthy vultures prevent the spread of disease. Their **highly acidic stomachs** and **short gastrointestinal tract** mean that they rarely get infected with any diseases, so they effectively "end" in the vulture population. Scavengers like vultures are under-appreciated. This is true even for human society. We do not value enough the sewer, or those who take our trash. Modern society is so much *cleaner* than ever before. Dealing with our byproducts makes us healthier; but, as we've seen with climate change, we rarely deal with them.
