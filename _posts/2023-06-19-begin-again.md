*Suggested listening: [Knife Party – “Begin Again”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWjzRvt6k1I)*.

Well, I am back. I fell off the wagon, but I’m starting again. I know people say that you don’t have to announce your comings and goings, the Internet is not an airport. But eh, this is mostly stream of consciousness anyway.

My life has changed drastically over the last few months. I moved to a new apartment, I started many new hobbies, and I have been healing my traumas. For the first time in my life, even though I’m not where I want to be, I am starting to be consistently happy. Younger me literally thought this was forever impossible.

I also want to participate more in this community. The Mastodon instance is nice but I am new to it. Since Reddit has decided to destroy their website, I am looking to fill the void that the small pool of curated communities helped fill in my life.

Here’s to getting back on the wagon. To channeling the beginner’s mind.

Day 13 of the #100DaysToOffload! I started at the beginning of this year, so I still have time!
