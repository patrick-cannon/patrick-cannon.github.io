Someone submitted a post to HN yesterday of the Wikipedia page [Telling the Bees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telling_the_bees). I like the micro-living that the phrase implies. The idea that, for big events (and probably even small ones!), you need to keep the bees informed or they will fly away, is just very…beautiful? It’s cute. And it’s a nice reminder to stop and slow down every so often. Maybe I’ll stop and “tell the bees” more about my day-to-day life. Maybe that’s what this blog is, even. You all are my bees. And maybe I can be one of yours :)
