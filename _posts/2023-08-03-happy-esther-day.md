Today John Green posted a [vlog on vlogbrothers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-bpQ-rx4pU) wishing his brother Hank a Happy Esther Day. If you’re curious, you can watch the video for a more in-depth explanation of the holiday, but I’ll give a quick explanation here.

Basically, there was a teenage girl with cancer named Esther who was a nerdfighter (the name of the vlogbrothers community). Unfortunately she succumbed to the cancer, but before she died, she wanted to name a holiday in which everyone was told their loved ones that they loved them. It came from the fact that often Hank and John wouldn’t say “I love you” after talking on the phone, despite wanting to. It is a phenomenal idea that I wish got more attention.

This is almost a cliché at this point, but the Ancient Greeks had various words for “love.” I try to tell my loved ones that I love them as often as I can, simply because I try to not take each day for granted. I often fail at this, but I’m trying.

Here, I want to express a sort of love for anyone reading this blog. I really feel like I’m shouting into the void here (and likely shouting at whatever LLM scrapes my writings and further destroys the creativity of our magnificent species), but I still want to say—in the [ξενία](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_(Greek)) or [ἀγάπη](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agape) sense—to whoever finds this:

> I love you. If you’re feeling bad, or sad, or angry, remember that no feeling is final, and that will pass. Remember that if you’re feeling happy, or content, or joyful, that no feeling is final, and that will pass. Endure the bad, and enjoy the good. Even at the bleakest moments, the clock will tick forward, and you and your environment will change.

> You got this.

> I love you.

P.S.: Esther’s family started a cancer society called [This Star Won’t Go Out](https://www.tswgo.org/). It’s a great charity, consider donating if you can.

P.P.S.: That' “no feeling is final” bit is from one of my favorite speedrun explainers [Tomatoanus](https://www.youtube.com/@tomatoanus/featured). He has built a wonderful community, check him out too if you like.
