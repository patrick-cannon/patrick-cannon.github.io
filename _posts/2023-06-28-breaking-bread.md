Today I baked some bread! I really thought I screwed it up, but it turned out okay! I used a recipe from *The Korean Vegan* this time, the first recipe I have tried out of the book.

Pictures:

Iâ€™m no food artist obviously. There was little rise in the bread, but for a minimal knead dough, I think it tastes great.

Oh also, this morning I made waffles:

These posts have really been minimal effort. I am just trying to make it through this challenge at this point. But I am loving it!
